This is a fun place to experiment, practice and be creative! 

To start use git desktop.


1. You'll need to download git to your machine.
* For windows use https://git-scm.com/download/win
* For mac https://www.git-scm.com/download/mac
   
3. You'll need to join https://github.com/

If you use vs-code, add the live server extension & click on the live browser button, that should be to the bottom left of your vscode screen.

If you use bash, run `xdg-open index.html` in your terminal to open the site in your browser. You
might need to install xdg-open first with `sudo apt install -y xdg-utils`

## Clone repository
Use ULI to clone repo

## Rules

1. Don't merge your own branch.
