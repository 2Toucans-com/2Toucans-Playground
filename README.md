1. You'll need to join https://github.com/

If you use vs-code, add the live server extension & click on the live browser button, that should be to the bottom left of your vscode screen.

If you use bash, run `xdg-open index.html` in your terminal to open the site in your browser. You
mignt need to install xdg-open first with `sudo apt install -y xdg-utils`
